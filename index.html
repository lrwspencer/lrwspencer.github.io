    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 6th year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at UCLA Anderson School of Management. My research focuses on Applied Microeconomics, Cultural Economics, and Economic History. I am particularly interested in the economic impacts of long-run changes in culture.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <h3>Research Agenda</h3>
    <p>My broader research uses tools from applied microeconomics to study the causal impact of cultural change on socioeconomic mobility, spatial development, and political outcomes. Across settings from 1930s London to 1980s America to the cultural politics of the 1960s, my work shows how culture shapes real-world economic and political patterns. My dissertation consists of three papers. The first, <strong>“Mind the Map: How the 1933 Tube Diagram Shaped London,”</strong> is my job market paper.</p>

    <h3>Mind the Map: How the 1933 Tube Diagram Shaped London</h3>
    <p>This paper investigates how changes in perceived geography influence urban economic activity, using the 1933 London Tube Diagram as a natural experiment. The diagram distorted actual distances, making certain areas appear closer to central London. I show that areas near stations that appeared closer experienced significantly more housing development, higher house prices, and more frequent mentions in newspapers. I compile new data using manual, machine learning, and AI-based methods. The paper contributes to the literature on intra-city economic geography and spatial misperceptions by demonstrating that visual representations of space can shape real economic outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Worshiping Alone: Religious Networks and Social Connections</h3>
    <p>This paper asks whether changes in religious attendance affect social connections across socioeconomic lines. Using the repeal of Blue Laws as an instrument, I show that such repeals led to a decline in economic connectedness in affected counties. The effect is strongest in more religious counties and those with more evangelicals. This paper contributes to the literature on religion, social capital, and socioeconomic mobility, offering new causal evidence of the role of religious participation in fostering cross-class connections.</p>

    <h3>Moral Panics and Electoral Backlash: Evidence from Beatlemania</h3>
    <p>Using the cultural phenomenon of Beatlemania, I study whether moral panics can cause electoral backlash. I show that counties where newspapers associated the Beatles with hysteria, craze, or frenzy moved more Republican between 1962 and 1964. This paper suggests that moral panics tied to popular culture can influence political behavior.</p>
